     The cat model inside the crepe  is actually my cat named Flynn! I got the inspiration when I took a picture of him a few months ago, on an app called “Snapchat”, and drew him inside a crepe for fun. I realized that I could use the picture as my reference, so I decided to go with that idea. It was a great decision because I really loved how it came out in the end. Unfortunately the CMYK version really mudded out a lot of the brighter colors so if I could redo it I would pay closer attention to the color pallet that I used.
