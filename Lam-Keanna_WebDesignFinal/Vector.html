     The character I drew in this project is from a very popular anime called Fairy Tail. His name is called Happy. I chose to illustrate him  because I wanted to do something simple, but  not too simple. I was sitting in my room one day, and saw him in one of my posters and I realized  his design was perfect, so I decided to draw him! I was going to include his friend in the picture too, but was unable to do so due to time constraints, but I think it still came out really nice!
