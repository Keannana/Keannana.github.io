     The legend goes that the ghost  is still looking for his friend. Just kidding. He did find a friend but scared him away sadly. The idea for the story came after I was inspired by a video I saw online of two ghosts singing, so I wanted to create something with a ghost too. However, the final animation didnâ€™t play out as well as I thought it would in my head, but I think the project went well for my first time working with Adobe Animate.
